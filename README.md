### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a research engineer in remote sensing and image processing, with an interest in the design and development of data processing chains for satellite image time series (optical and radar) and applications of data science approaches such as deep learning. Experience in development with Python (Pytorch, Dask, EtcÃ©tÃ©ra), R and Matlab and open source software such as GRASS GIS or Orfeo Toolbox.
